## Travel Map


This project creates the frontend and backend of a website designed to display information about my 3 month trip to South East Asia. Part of the website is an interactive map where I can view each place I am going, how I am getting there and details about what I will do. 

I am using html, css and javascript to create the webpages and python to create the backend.

### Current aims:
- update page to be able to add and remove stops along the journey
- then add functionality to change details - change name of a place, change the location, change transport method
- add details to each stop to display an itinerary when clicking on a place
- update the design, making it look more well rounded fro a user to view
- add functionality to the emergency info page, updating with the current countries in the map
